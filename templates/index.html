    <h1> Soup or Dumpling? </h1>
    <p>The soup or dumpling hypothesis posits that all dishes can be classified as variations on soup or dumplings. 
        Pizza, for example, is a deconstructed dumpling. Sometimes, however, it can be difficult
        to determine whether a particular dish should be classified as a soup or a dumpling. The 
        AI below uses machine learning to classify any dish as a soup or a dumpling.</p>

<h3> Why an AI? </h3>
<p> The soup-dumpling hypothesis currently lacks a principled theory about what
makes a dish either a soup or dumpling.  To date, all theories put forth (e.g,
topological agruments) have not been well accepted in the community. By
training an AI against well-accepted examples, the AI should learn to
generalize to other foods that are more contentious. While this does not
generate a principled theory, the AI may learn to empirically draw the boundary
between soups and dumplings, should such a boundary exist.  </p>
